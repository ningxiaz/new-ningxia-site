block description
  p.subtext.
    I aspire to design and build experiences that are useful, pleasant and meaningful. To me, good design solutions come from deep empathy of the users, comprehensive understanding of the problem including constraints and business objectives, fast iterations with feedback, and intentional decisions with solid reasoning.
