          In 2018, I started to be interested in Virtual Reality. [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) is a WebVR library that makes it easy to create VR experiences with Web technologies that I'm already familiar with.

          Weightless is a series of VR installations, with generative, minimal and geometric qualities. In a virtual world, physics doesnâ€™t naturally apply and repetition happens at milliseconds. These works explore such a medium and pose the questions of the distinctions of the two worlds.

          You can experience it here: [https://weightless.glitch.me/](https://weightless.glitch.me/).

          Support desktop browsers (keyboard and mouse interactions), mobile browsers (tilting and tapping) and Google Cardboard. Use your cursor to click on the doors to navigate.

          It was featured on the weekly blog A-Frame [A Week of A-Frame 96 + 97](https://aframe.io/blog/awoa-96-97/).
